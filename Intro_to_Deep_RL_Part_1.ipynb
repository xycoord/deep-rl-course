Now all of the seeds we tested reach 500 cumulative reward, which means we've effectively solved the CartPole environment (reaching its maximum possible reward). It's worth noting that CartPole is considered one of the simpler RL benchmark environments. For more complex environments with higher-dimensional spaces, longer time horizons, and sparse rewards, even reward-to-go—while powerful—isn't enough on its own. We'll need additional variance reduction techniques to achieve stable learning in these  scenarios."
