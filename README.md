## üìã Prerequisites

- Machine Learning (Gradient Descent, Neural Networks)
- Basic Probability Theory (Expectations and Distributions)
- Multivariate Calculus
- Python and PyTorch

## üìö Course Style

Each module consists of:
- Formal mathematical definitions and theory
- Step-by-step algorithm derivations
- Complete PyTorch implementations
- Runnable experiments

I recommend working through the notebooks carefully, especially the mathematical derivations and proofs, and ensuring you understand each concept before moving on. This material is designed to be precise and concise so that you can learn efficiently - without rushing through.
